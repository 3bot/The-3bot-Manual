# Hello World

This how to applies to the [3bot cloud](http://my.3bot.io) and shows how to download a dummy image form [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/). This may be different form the self hosted 3bot in some points.

* After that your worker is up and running (accesible), you could [clone this task](https://my.3bot.io/task/1-40-download-a-placeholder-image/) from 3bot to your own team.
* Use the wheel on the right side and select "Clone for <your team>" .

* Once done, go the the fresh cloned task that belongs to <your team> now. 
* Again click on the wheel and select "New Workflow". This creates a [workflow](https://github.com/3bot/The-3bot-Manual/blob/master/workflow.md) containing this task. 
* Select your worker and press "Perform". 
* You will be prompted to enter an image path.
